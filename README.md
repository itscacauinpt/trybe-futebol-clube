Before anything, you'll need to run <code> npm run build </code> in your terminal (inside the back-end file), to build the application.

#### **Database:**
It will be a MySQL docker container already configured in docker-compose via a service defined as `db`.
It has the role of providing data to the _backend_ service.
You can also connect to a MySQL Client (Workbench, Beekeeper, DBeaver and etc) by putting the credentials configured in docker-compose into the `db` service.
