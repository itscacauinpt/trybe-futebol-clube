# Trybe Futebol Club 

Project done individually during the course of the <a href="https://www.betrybe.com">Trybe</a>.

"TFC is an informative website about soccer matches and standings! :soccer:

On the TFC development team, your squad is responsible for developing an API (using the TDD method) and also integrating - through docker-compose - the applications so that they work by consuming a database.

In this project, you will build a dockerized back-end using Sequelize data modeling. Your development must respect business rules provided in the project and your API must be able to be consumed by a front-end already provided in this project.

To add a match it is necessary to have a token, so the person must be logged in to make changes. We will have a relationship between the teams and matches tables to update matches.

Your back-end will have to implement business rules to properly populate the table available on the front-end that will be displayed to the person using the system."

### :woman_technologist: Project Structure

Before anything, you'll need to run <code> npm run build </code> in your terminal (inside the back-end file), to build the application.

#### **Database:**
It will be a MySQL docker container already configured in docker-compose via a service defined as `db`.
It has the role of providing data to the _backend_ service.
You can also connect to a MySQL Client (Workbench, Beekeeper, DBeaver and etc) by putting the credentials configured in docker-compose into the `db` service.
